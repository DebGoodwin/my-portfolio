                        <p>Iâ€™m in Queen Creek, Arizona, currently studying software engineering at Thinkful. I have always been 
                            interested in software and technology, and am currently learning web design, 
                            frontend foundations, CSS Frameworks and JavaScript. 
                        </p>
                        <p>My goal is to begin a career in website development. I am excited to be able to 
                            use the tools that I have learned, to become a valuable member of a software development team.</p>

                        <p>I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University, and
                        worked as a software engineer for several years, before taking time off to raise three awesome children.
                        I am interested in rejoining the software industry to pursue my passion for technology. </p>
                        <p>When not designing websites, I can be found spending time in the great outdoors. I enjoy hiking, gardening,
